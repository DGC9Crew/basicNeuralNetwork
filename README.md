# basicNeuralNetwork

this program is a very basic neural network, one i wrote in java after taking a tutorial in python. i don't know python.

it is a neuralnetwork that determines wheather a number is closer to 100 or 0, without using any mathematical operations but rather just learning it.

it is not perfect but it does work to an extent.
